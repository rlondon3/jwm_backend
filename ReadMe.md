## **About the Project**

This project represents my dedication to creating a robust and scalable platform that merges traditional martial arts learning with modern technology. The backend of this app is built using Node.js and PostgreSQL, with a focus on providing secure, efficient, and reliable services for the frontend. My goal is to create an ecosystem where users can read, listen, watch, and interact with martial arts content while engaging in live or recorded lessons.

The journey has been an exciting challenge, allowing me to deepen my understanding of backend development, DevOps practices, and modern infrastructure management. I'm eager to share this project with potential employers who are interested in my technical growth and commitment to building meaningful applications.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Node.js**: The core framework for the backend, providing a scalable and high-performance environment.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js used to build RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the PostgreSQL database to ensure a consistent development environment.
- **Jasmine**: Unit testing framework and assertion library for Node.js.
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- **AWS**: S3 for serving frontend assets, Route 53 for DNS management.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for managing AWS resources.
- **Google SSO**: For secure user authentication.

## **Features**

- **User Authentication and Management**: Secure login and registration, including Google SSO integration.
- **Interactive Content Delivery**: API endpoints for serving chapter content, multimedia resources, and scheduling instructor sessions.
- **Session Management**: Schedule and manage Zoom lessons or video correspondence directly from the content.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor user progress through chapters and multimedia content.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Dockerized PostgreSQL and automated deployments using Terraform and GitHub Actions.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests written in Jasmine for backend services.

## **Project Management**

This platform has allowed me to stay organized, maintain focus, and continuously deliver features.

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Additional Authentication Providers**: Integrate other SSO providers (e.g., Facebook, Twitter).
- **Enhanced Media Streaming**: Improve the delivery of video and audio content with real-time streaming capabilities.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Implement user analytics to provide insights into learning patterns and content engagement.
- **Instructor Dashboard**: A dedicated dashboard for instructors to manage their sessions, content, and student interactions.
